TrophicIncoherencePanel.jXHeader1.description=The Trophic Incoherence plugin calculates the trophic incoherence of a directed network, as well as the trophic level of each node in the network.\n\nIf multiple weakly connected components exist in the networks, then the trophic incoherence and trophic levels are calculated for each component separately.\n\nReference: \nMacKay R.
